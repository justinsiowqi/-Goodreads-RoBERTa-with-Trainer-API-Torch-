Welcome back to Part 2 of the series! 

In the [previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/justinsiow/goodreads-distilbert-automodel-tensorflow), we used the HuggingFace transformers library to predict book ratings. Specifically, we created a **DistilBERT** AutoTokenizer and AutoModel and achieved an accuracy of **0.56808**. 

In this notebook, we will take advantage of two other HuggingFace libraries (**datasets** and **evaluate**) to process the data and evaluate the model's performance. Instead of using the DistilBERT model, we will use a bigger model called **RoBERTa** and train it using the **Trainer API**. By increasing the amount of training data twofold, we managed to get a better accuracy of **0.59792**.
